# SIMPLE Website (CRUD) Using Golang and HTML

I'm using a MVC model in this repo. This website using a SQL (MySQL) database. I use XAMPP for runing the MySQL service.
I'm not using any framework in this project, just simple native Golang.

I use driver for SQL from https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql , thank you for making this driver.
First, u need to clone/install that driver, u can read it from the repo in the link i gave it, and then u can modify the database setup as u like.
